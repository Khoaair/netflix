<h1 align= center><b>⭐️ Netflix Clone ⭐️</b></h1>
<h3 align = center> Movie and TV series application </h3>

## Introduction

This application (Netflix Clone) has two sides, one is client-side was built using ReactJS(Context, Custom Hooks), and the server side was built using nodeJS, express, and MongoDB. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browser, and lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. This application has another admin dashboard to manage users, movies, and movie lists,... If you are an admin, you can create, update, and delete users, movies, and movie lists.
